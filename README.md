# clj-puredata

FIXME: description

## Roadmap

- [x] live reloading of newly generated patches into PureData
- [x] parsing hiccup syntax.
- [x] writing of PureData patch format.
- [ ] layout engine: uses ascii dims, maybe nicer with image dims?
- [ ] layout engine: don't overwrite nodes that already have :x or :y set.
- [ ] missing node types: float, symbol, sliders/buttons etc.
- [ ] finish patch footer template for "graph on parent" options.
- [ ] patches (e.g. ["patch.pd" ...] should be recognized).
- [ ] subpatches (needs multiple parsing contexts? e.g. map of context instead of single atom)

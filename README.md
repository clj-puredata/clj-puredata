# clj-puredata

clj-puredata generates [PureData](https://puredata.info/) patches using [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).
It supports live reloading, has a simple layouter that automatically arranges the generated patches

Check the [documentation](doc/index.md), especially the [Tutorial](doc/tutorial.md).

## Installation

Using Leiningen/Boot: `[clj-puredata "0.2.0-SNAPSHOT"]`

## Usage

This will create a `counter.pd` patch, use it in a `usage.pd` patch, and start PureData with that patch.
Whenever you change and re-evaluage the `write-patch-reload` form, the patch will be updated in PureData as well.

```clojure
(ns example.core
  (:require [clj-puredata.core :refer :all]))
    
(write-patch "counter.pd"
             [:outlet [:float {:name 'the-float}
                       0
                       [:b [:inlet]]
                       [:+ 1 (other 'the-float)]]])

(write-patch-reload "usage.pd"
                    [:print "count"
                     ["counter.pd"
                      [:msg "bang"]]])

(startup "usage.pd")
```

## Roadmap

- [x] live reloading of newly generated patches into PureData
- [x] parsing hiccup syntax.
- [x] writing of PureData patch format.
- [x] layout engine: uses ascii dims, maybe nicer with image dims?
- [x] layout engine: don't overwrite nodes that already have :x or :y set.
- [x] layout engine: push auto-layouted nodes down (so they're outside the graph-on-parent frame).
- [x] missing node types: float, symbol, sliders/buttons etc.
- [x] finish patch footer template for "graph on parent" options.
- [x] patches (e.g. ["patch.pd" ...] should be recognized).
- [x] remove the need for explicit PD anywhere - make it implicit in WITH-PATCH, INLET, OUTLET, OTHER.
- [ ] subpatches (needs multiple parsing contexts? e.g. map of context instead of single atom)
- [ ] helpers for coloring ui-nodes (copy from cl-pd)
- [ ] `connect` function & supporting data structure for adding connections after node creation
- [ ] layouter should sort node arguments by inlet number (instead of argument position)
- [ ] DEBUG: do `inlet` and `outlet` work on `other`???
- [ ] add support for `:left`, `:right`, `:first`, `:second`, etc. as arguments to `inlet` or `outlet`

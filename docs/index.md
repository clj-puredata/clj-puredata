# clj-puredata

clj-puredata is a [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) library for generating [PureData](https://puredata.info/) patches.

## Quick Start

This will create a `counter.pd` patch, use it in a `usage.pd` patch, and start PureData with that patch.
Whenever you change and re-evaluate the `write-patch-reload` form, the patch will be updated in PureData as well.

```clojure
(ns example.core
  (:require [clj-puredata.core :refer :all]))

(write-patch "counter.pd"
             [:outlet [:float {:name 'the-float}
                       0
                       [:b [:inlet]]
                       [:+ 1 (other 'the-float)]]])

(write-patch-reload "usage.pd"
                    [:print "count"
                     ["counter.pd"
                      [:msg "bang"]]])

(startup "usage.pd")
```

## Features:

- Supports most vanilla nodes
- Supports live coding (by reloading changed patches)
- Automatic patch layouter for node placement

### Why use it?

- Batch-operations on many nodes are done very quickly.
- Variations can be automatically created, in large numbers, in little time.
- UIs can be layouted algorithmically, without the hassle of manual pixel-perfect adjustments.
- The automatic layouter works okay for most simple patches.
- Less clicking, more typing.

### Why NOT use it?

- Requires basic knowledge of Clojure.
- Requires solid knowledge of PureData node names, their inputs and outputs; there are no helpers for that yet.
- Patches are hard to reason about in code, without the visual aid.
- The automatic layouter is kind of primitive and produces bad results in complex patches.
- Less clicking, more typing.

## Installation

Add the following to your `:dependencies`:

```
[clj-puredata "0.3.2"]
```

## Documentation

- [Tutorial](tutorial.md)
- [Full Documentation Index](file-index.md)
- API Docs (ToDo)

## Roadmap

- [x] add support for radio ui nodes
  - [ ] find out what the constant "1" in the `radio-nodes` template is used for
  [ ] check changes in file format for version >48
    [ ] find out what trailing `, f N` means for nodes (appears to set width to N on some nodes)
- [ ] subpatches (needs multiple parsing contexts? e.g. map of context instead of single atom)
- [ ] layouter should sort node arguments by inlet number (instead of argument position)
- [ ] add support for `:left`, `:right`, `:first`, `:second`, etc. as arguments to `inlet` or `outlet`
  (q: how? some nodes have variable # of inlets/outlets)
- [ ] make layout engine ignore any nodes that have :x or :y set (also ignore them when setting column widths or offsets).
)
- [ ] fix bug in layouter where two nodes can occupy the same position
- [ ] fix behavior in layouter where any completely circular part of a patch is pushed into the top-left corner and not layouted correctly.
- [ ] add optional arguments `:inlet`, `:outlet` to `other` -- `(other 'ref :inlet 0 :outlet 1)`
- [ ] add helper `in-out-lets` that can supply both `:inlet` and `:outlet` in one call?
- [ ] for consistency, rename `other` to `ref` and use node options key `:ref` instead of `:name` to reference other nodes.

## Changelog

- [x] live reloading of newly generated patches into PureData
- [x] parsing hiccup syntax.
- [x] writing of PureData patch format.
- [x] layout engine: uses ascii dims, maybe nicer with image dims?
- [x] layout engine: don't overwrite nodes that already have :x or :y set.
- [x] layout engine: push auto-layouted nodes down (so they're outside the graph-on-parent frame).
- [x] missing node types: float, symbol, sliders/buttons etc.
- [x] finish patch footer template for "graph on parent" options.
- [x] patches (e.g. ["patch.pd" ...] should be recognized).
- [x] remove the need for explicit PD anywhere - make it implicit in WITH-PATCH, INLET, OUTLET, OTHER.
- [x] DEBUG: do `inlet` and `outlet` work on `other`???
- [x] `connect` function & supporting data structure for adding connections after node creation
- [x] make `write-patch-reload` return file string as well.
- [x] helpers for coloring ui-nodes (copy from cl-pd)
- [x] Redo Tutorial for Options, use UI node with Colors for demonstration
- [x] expand resources into separate directory (e.g. `helper-patches`) instead of `./` root.
- [x] put generated patches into a `patch` subdirectory instead of `./` root.
- [x] add image-to-patch functionality.
- [x] clarify gotchas like the use of dashes in signal-nodes like `[:+-]`
- [x] fix bug in layouter that calculates node size of messages wrong (workaround: limit at 25 characters node size
